## Summary

While building this app I really focused on my ability to create dynamic elements and append them to the DOM. While 
building an app completely on my own using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS was challenging I loved every minute
of it! This app was also special to me because I was able to succesfully add local storage using Vanilla Javascript to 
store user inputs locally.
